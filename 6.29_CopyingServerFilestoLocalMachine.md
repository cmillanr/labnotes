### Copy files from remote server to local machine, then vice versa

First, I launched my AWS instance. 

Then I went to the location of my .pem key. I used the command `ls -l` to check the permissions in the file and noticed it was -rw------. This means that only the admin has permission to read or write it. 

Next, I used the command `ssh -vi key.pem admin@instance`, where "instance" is my Public IP address.

The instance successfully connected! One of the ways I check this is that it tells me the last login to this instance. I also used the command `ls` to double check I was looking at my files. 

Now, I will try to copy a file from the server into my local computer. I decide to copy dogs.csv 

First, I suspend the connection to the server using `~` + `ctrl-z`. Note: this only works if the `~` is silent. 

Then I used the code `scp -i key.pem admin@instance:test.py .`, where `test.py` is the file I'm trying to download from the server into the local host. This worked! Because I used a period at the end, it downloads the file directly to the original location in the local server. 

Now I also try downloading it to a specified location. 

When I used this code `scp -i key.pem admin@instance.test.py /~` apparently it donwloaded correctly, but then when I tried to check the location, I wasn't able to find it. ??

I used the code `scp -i key.pem admin@instance.test.py /home/Carolina` 

Then I used `cd home/Carolina` to double check that the file had successfully transferred. Hooray! 

### Copy a file from local machine to remote server

First, I create a dummy file to work with. I go back to the original location and use `touch` to create a dummy file, transferfile.txt

I used the code `scp transferfile.txt admin@instance:` but that returned an error: Permission denied (public key). Lost connection. 

I tried to double check if I had lost connection, so I used `fg` to switch back to the server. It connected without problems.

I flipped back to the local machine. 

I decided to try again, this time removing the colon `scp transferfile.txt admin@instance` . It didn't give an error message so I switched to the server, but the file wasn't there. 

Since that didn't work, I tried a few other things after looking at this [stackoverflow page](http://superuser.com/questions/432218/how-to-copy-a-file-to-a-remote-server-using-the-command-line): `scp transferfile.txt admin@instance: .` and also `scp transferfile.txt admin@instance:/notebooks`. 

All of these returned the error "Permission denied (public key). Lost connection"



([here](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2857/ssh-easily-copy-file-to-local-system)'s another page that I found, but that seemed to be solving the problem by bypassing this particular process...)
